# **DreamTimer** 

DreamTimer is a program designed for falling asleep :sleeping: to the sound of your favorite music or quietly watching a movie, series, etc., without worrying about shutting down your PC.

With this application, you can easily schedule your computer to turn off automatically after a time period you select.

This timer is effective and provides you with the opportunity to fall asleep with peace of mind.

This software represents an enhanced iteration of my SleepTimer repository [SleepTimer](https://github.com/EpicKOM/SleepTimer).

DreamTimer provides a **clear** and **modern** interface. 
The program is developed in C# using the WPF user interface framework.
